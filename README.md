This is a sandbox to store code long-term for a hobby project of mine.

The main big-picture goal of the project is to be able to render pixels directly to the screen without an operating system and have some sort of clock available to be able to do some animation. Some smaller goals will be implementing bits of the c standard library and also some math funtionality (sin, cos, etc.)
